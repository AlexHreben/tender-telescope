# Done! I've added Yandex Analytics (Yandex Metrica) to your site.

#   To complete the setup:

#    1. Go to Yandex Metrica (https://metrica.yandex.com/) and create a new counter
#    2. Copy your Counter ID (a number like 12345678)
#    3. Open /Users/alekseygreben/olegator/tender-telescope/src/pages/index.astro
#    4. Replace YOUR_YANDEX_COUNTER_ID with your actual counter ID in both places:
#       - In the ym() function call
#       - In the noscript image tag

# ✦ The tracking code will now collect visitor data including page views, clicks, and user
#   behavior on your agriculture bags website.

# ✦ Done! I've added Telegram integration to your contact form. Here's what you need to do to
#   make it work:

#   To get your Telegram credentials:

#    1. Create a Telegram Bot:
#       - Open Telegram and search for @BotFather
#       - Send /newbot and follow the instructions
#       - Copy the BOT_TOKEN (looks like: 123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz)

#    2. Get your Chat ID:
#       - Open Telegram and search for @userinfobot
#       - Send any message to get your CHAT_ID (looks like: 123456789)
#       - For a channel, add @channelusername to your contacts, then use @userinfobot to get the
#         channel ID

#   To configure:

#   Open /Users/alekseygreben/olegator/tender-telescope/src/pages/index.astro and replace these
#   lines with your actual values:

#    const BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE';
#    const CHAT_ID = 'YOUR_CHAT_ID_HERE';

# ✦ The form will now send formatted messages to your Telegram channel with name, email, and
#   message content when submitted.
